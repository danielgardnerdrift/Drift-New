# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Streaming Response Mechanism
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4, 5, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a streaming response mechanism for real-time chat updates using Server-Sent Events (SSE).
# Details:
1. Implement SSE endpoint in FastAPI:
   ```python
   @app.get("/api/stream/{conversation_id}")
   async def stream_response(conversation_id: int, request: Request):
       return EventSourceResponse(generate_events(conversation_id))
   ```
2. Create streaming client in Next.js:
   ```typescript
   const streamResponse = async (conversationId: number) => {
     const eventSource = new EventSource(`/api/stream/${conversationId}`);
     eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
       // Process streamed response
     };
   };
   ```
3. Implement sentence-by-sentence streaming for better UX
4. Add typing indicators during streaming
5. Implement reconnection logic for dropped connections
6. Create buffering mechanism for smooth display
7. Add progress tracking for long responses
8. Implement token counting for billing purposes
9. Create abort controller for cancelling streams

# Test Strategy:
1. Test streaming with various response lengths
2. Verify reconnection works after connection drops
3. Test concurrent streams for multiple conversations
4. Measure latency and optimize if needed
5. Test cancellation with abort controller
6. Validate token counting accuracy
