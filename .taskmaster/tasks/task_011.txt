# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Authentication and Session Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create authentication flow and session management for user identification and persistence.
# Details:
1. Implement authentication API integration with Xano:
   ```typescript
   const login = async (email: string, password: string) => {
     const response = await xanoClient.post('/auth/login', { email, password });
     // Handle response and store token
   };
   ```
2. Create session management with cookies or localStorage
3. Implement protected routes with authentication checks
4. Add user profile management
5. Create session recovery mechanism
6. Implement token refresh logic
7. Add logout functionality
8. Create guest session handling for unauthenticated users
9. Implement session timeout handling

# Test Strategy:
1. Test login/signup flows with valid and invalid credentials
2. Verify session persistence across page refreshes
3. Test protected routes with and without authentication
4. Validate token refresh works correctly
5. Test session timeout and recovery
6. Verify guest sessions work as expected
