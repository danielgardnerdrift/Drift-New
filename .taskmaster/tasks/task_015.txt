# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Deployment Pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create deployment configuration and CI/CD pipeline for both frontend and backend services.
# Details:
1. Create docker-compose.yml as specified in PRD:
   ```yaml
   version: '3.8'
   services:
     frontend:
       build: ./drift-frontend
       ports:
         - "3000:3000"
       environment:
         - NEXT_PUBLIC_XANO_API_URL
     
     langgraph:
       build: ./drift-langgraph
       ports:
         - "8000:8000"
       environment:
         - OPENAI_API_KEY
         - GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY
   ```
2. Set up Vercel deployment for Next.js frontend
3. Configure Railway deployment for LangGraph service
4. Create GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD:
   ```yaml
   name: CI/CD Pipeline
   on:
     push:
       branches: [main]
   jobs:
     test:
       # Test job configuration
     build:
       # Build job configuration
     deploy:
       # Deploy job configuration
   ```
5. Implement environment-specific configurations
6. Add monitoring and alerting setup
7. Create database migration scripts
8. Implement rollback procedures
9. Add performance monitoring integration

# Test Strategy:
1. Test Docker builds for both services
2. Verify CI/CD pipeline with test deployments
3. Test environment-specific configurations
4. Validate monitoring and alerting setup
5. Test rollback procedures
6. Verify performance monitoring captures relevant metrics
