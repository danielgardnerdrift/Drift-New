# Title: Implement Theysis Dynamic Form Generation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate Theysis for dynamic form generation based on the data collection requirements of each workflow.
# Details:
1. Create `theysis.config.ts` with form definitions as specified in PRD
2. Implement `components/TheysisChat.tsx` for rendering dynamic forms
3. Create form schemas for each workflow:
   - Shopper Showroom (workflow_id = 2)
   - Personal Showroom (workflow_id = 3)
4. Implement form validation rules
5. Add styling consistent with Drift brand
6. Create form submission handlers
7. Implement dynamic field rendering based on next_field
8. Add support for different input types (text, select, number, etc.)
9. Implement field dependencies (e.g., model options based on selected make)
10. Create error handling for form validation

# Test Strategy:
1. Test form rendering with various field types
2. Verify validation rules work correctly
3. Test form submission and data collection
4. Validate accessibility of generated forms
5. Test responsive behavior on different devices
6. Verify dynamic field updates based on dependencies
