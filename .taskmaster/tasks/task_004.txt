# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Chat Interface Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create React components for the chat interface including message display, input field, and typing indicators.
# Details:
1. Create the following components:
   - `components/ChatInterface.tsx`: Main chat container
   - `components/MessageList.tsx`: Display chat history
   - `components/MessageInput.tsx`: User input field
   - `components/TypingIndicator.tsx`: Show when bot is responding
   - `components/Message.tsx`: Individual message display
2. Implement real-time features:
   - Typing indicators showing "driftBot is thinking..."
   - Animated dots during response generation
   - Auto-scroll to latest message
3. Style components using Tailwind CSS with the Drift brand colors
4. Add support for different message types (text, forms, links)
5. Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop
6. Add accessibility features (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
7. Optimize for performance with React.memo and useCallback
8. Implement smooth animations for message transitions

# Test Strategy:
1. Write unit tests for each component using React Testing Library
2. Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes
3. Verify accessibility with automated tools (axe-core)
4. Test keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
5. Validate performance with React DevTools
6. Test animation smoothness across browsers
